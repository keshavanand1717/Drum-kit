# Drum-kit
I have used HTML,JavaScript and CSS to make this project. In this project, I basically have applied the concepts of JavaScript that I learned to make a drum-set. This drumset can be played by either pressing the keys shown on the images or by clicking on the images by the pointer. 

So, go ahead and try it...press the keys and enjoy playing drum..ðŸ™ƒ.

I love this project cuz. this is the first project I made using Web Development tools.
